# Truly Zen

A Zed editor theme for total concentration. Dark, minimal, and just a little bit mysterious.

## What's the vibe?

Truly Zen is what happens when you take a pure black canvas and sprinkle in teal accents like digital tea leaves. It's designed to disappear into the background so you can focus on what actually matters: your code.

**The aesthetic:**
- Pitch black backgrounds (#000000) because why waste pixels?
- Teal highlights (#14B8A6) that pop without screaming
- Soft grey text that doesn't strain your eyes at 3am
- Purple functions (#9D70FF) because life needs a little color
- White keywords for maximum readability

**Two flavors included:**
- **Truly Zen Dark** — the classic experience
- **Truly Zen Dark Italics** — same zen, but with italics on keywords and comments for extra flow state
